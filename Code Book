Data cleaning and organization overview overview:

1) the training and the test datasets are stacked
2) subject ids are added
3) activities are added
3) activity labels are added
4) descriptive variable names are added
5) keep only variable names containing "mean()" or "std()"
6) calculated mean of each variable for each subject/activity

For more information see the Reamed.Rmd file and the
run_analysis.R program both are also contained in this repo.

There are 68 variables in this summarized data set.

Each measurement is in its own column and each subject's activity is in one row.

The following is a data dictionary.

 "subject_id" = This is the subject number [1-30]                  
 "activity"   = This is the activity that was measured  
                [STANDING   SITTING  LAYING  WALKING WALKING DOWNSTAIRS  WALKING UPSTAIRS]  
    
    
 All the variables represent either mean or standard deviation values.
